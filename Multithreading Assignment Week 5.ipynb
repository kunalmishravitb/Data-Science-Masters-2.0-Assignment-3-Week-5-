A thread is a lightweight unit of execution that can run concurrently with other threads, sharing the same memory space.

    "(1) Improved performance and responsiveness: Multithreading allows multiple tasks to execute simultaneously, utilizing available CPU resources more efficiently and potentially reducing overall execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Better resource utilization: Multithreading can make better use of system resources by efficiently sharing memory and CPU time between threads, reducing the overall resource footprint of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Enhanced concurrency: Multithreading enables concurrent execution of tasks, making it suitable for handling parallelizable tasks such as I/O operations or independent computations.\n",

    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Complexity: Multithreaded programs can be more complex to design, implement, and debug compared to single-threaded programs. Synchronization and coordination between threads can introduce issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Increased overhead: Thread creation, context switching, and synchronization mechanisms incur additional overhead compared to single-threaded programs. This overhead can be significant for programs with many threads or in situations where threads frequently interact or share resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Difficulty in debugging: Multithreaded programs can be harder to debug due to non-deterministic behavior caused by race conditions or timing-related issues. Debugging tools and techniques specific to multithreading are required to effectively diagnose and fix issues."

This situation arises when multiple threads compete for exclusive access to shared resources and each thread holds a resource while waiting for another resource that is held by a different thread. As a result, the threads are unable to make progress, leading to a deadlock.\n",

    "Race condition: A race condition occurs when the behavior or outcome of a program depends on the relative timing or interleaving of multiple threads. It arises when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and at least one thread modifies the shared data. The exact sequence of thread execution determines the final outcome, and if the timing is not properly synchronized, it can lead to unexpected and incorrect results."
